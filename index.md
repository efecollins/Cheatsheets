# Tech School Cheatsheet:

This is a cheatsheet for those who are attending a tech school, bootcamp or training on tech.

1. Be prepared to learn a lot in a short amount of time. Tech schools typically have intensive, accelerated programs that cover a wide range of technical skills.

2. Be ready to work in teams. Many tech school projects and assignments involve collaboration with your classmates.

3. Be ready to learn by doing. Tech schools often use a hands-on, project-based approach to learning, which means you'll be working on real-world problems and projects rather than just reading from a textbook.

4. Be prepared for a lot of hands-on work. Tech schools focus on practical skills, so you'll be doing a lot of hands-on work, such as coding, building, and designing.

5. Stay organized. With so much information to learn and so many projects to work on, it's important to stay organized and keep track of your assignments and deadlines.

6. Take advantage of resources. Tech schools typically have a wide range of resources available to students, such as labs, equipment, and software, so make sure you know what's available and how to use it.

7. Network. Tech school is a great opportunity to network and make connections with other students and professionals in the field.

8. Stay focused. With the fast-paced, intense nature of tech school, it's important to stay focused and avoid distractions.

9. Be open to learning and trying new things. Tech school is an opportunity to learn and grow, so be open to new ideas and be willing to step out of your comfort zone.

10. Have fun. Tech school can be challenging, but it's also an exciting and rewarding experience. Don't forget to have fun and enjoy the journey!
